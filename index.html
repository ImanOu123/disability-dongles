            <h2>Motivation: The Disability Dongle</h2>
            Liz Jackson, an advocate for disability-led design practice defined the <b>disability 
            dongle</b> as assistive technologies created to solve "a real or perceived 
            problem experienced by disabled people, but which was built without 
            including disabled people in the design process."

            <blockquote>
                   Disability Dongle rhetoric instills in students the value of a quick fix over 
                   structural change, thus preventing them from seeking out, participating in, and contributing 
                   to existing inquiry.

            </blockquote>
            In that vein, we seek to provide a framework that leads designers to ask constructive questions 
            about their work and seek solutions with real impact for people with disabilities. 
            
            <h2> Who are you? </h2>
            You are a designer, researcher, engineer or student planning 
            to build or building an assistive technology targeted towards people with disabilities. 
            You want to create the best possible outcome for your technology such that it doesn’t 
            pose any harm to the intended users of your product. You will use this tool to 
            identify any potential harm that your product might pose.

            
            <h2>How to use?</h2> 
            There are seven considerations that you need to consider when you are building 
            the assistive technology: problem definition, solution definition, cost, usage, rhetoric, 
            creation process and impact of technology. Under each of these considerations, there is a 
            series of questions that you answer to the best of your ability to help you interrogate 
            these considerations. You can answer these questions based on what you have already completed 
            in your design process or what you plan to do. It is better to answer these questions as early 
            as possible in the creation process to make it easier to reframe your work, if needed. 
            <br><br>
            Based on your answers to the questions, consider the suggestions.

        <h2 id="sec_title">Considerations</h2>
        
        <p id="desc"> Note the <b>intended users</b> are the people who this assistive technology is meant to or 
            can serve. We don’t use the general term person with disability to describe the user - even 
            though it adds a more 'human' element to describe the audience - to the type of people who assistive 
            technology is made for, because it is too general. For example, there needs to be a distinction 
            between a ‘person with a disability’ being involved in the design process of the technology vs a 
            person with the specific disability that the technology is meant to target.

                <ul>

                        or finding an accessibility consultant. </li>
                    <li> If that is not possible, consider running a focus group with the intended

                    <li>Based on the solution defined, does the solution the technology offers expect the intended

                Think about why a framing such as this is problematic and can enact harm on the intended users. 
                Then, reframe your solution such that it doesn’t have these expectations on its users or consider 
                broadening the scope of the technology beyond assistive technology.

                <ul>
                    <li>Then, if your ultimate goal is to build a new and innovative technology, consider broadening

                    <li>Or, if your ultimate goal is to solve the ‘problem’, consider pursuing

                Reflect why the technology incurs such costs. Is the technology expensive from the get-go or does it accumulate costs over time? 
                Also, reflect on how these costs will translate into people’s lives. Then, based on these reflections, problem solve where to reduce 
                costs to make it more affordable or how the intended users can use external help such as government/non-government programs that can 
                help people afford it.

            materials published by the creators. Finally, for both projects also look at the informal messaging you use during the creation

                    <li>Does the messaging around the technology involve harmful terminology? (Answer with reference to <a href="https://www.ungeneva.org/sites/default/files/2021-01/Disability-Inclusive-Language-Guidelines.pdf">
                        UN list of terminology to avoid</a>)</li>
                    <hr>
                    <li>Does the messaging around the technology focus more on the innovation than the assistance it provides to the user?</li>

                <h4>Suggestions</h4> 
                <p>If the messaging uses bad terminology...</p>
                Reframing the messaging you use, based on the provided resource.
                <hr>
                <p>If there is more focus on the innovation of the technology...</p>
                Think about what the purpose of creating this technology has been for you. Is it to create something innovative or is it to help people? 
                If innovation takes a higher importance, consider broadening the scope of the technology beyond assistive technology. If helping people is 
                more important, consider focusing more on the benefits and impact the technology has on the intended audience in its messaging.

                <ol>
                    <li>For each stage above, highlight the level of involvement of the intended users at each stage</li>
                    <br>
                    The following are the different possible levels of involvement:
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>Disability-led (at least 1 person with disabilities is in charge and has agency and power)</li>
                        <li>Participatory, Co-design, and/or Disability-centered (at least 1 person with disabilities is treated as an equal to other decision-makers and considered a "subject matter expert" in matters related to their disability)</li>
                        <li>"Inclusive" (person with disabilities are present in some way, but their role isn't explicitly equal in power with decision-makers)</li>
                        <li>Participant/user (typically brought in to evaluate as part of a study or test but don't have active power or agency to make decisions)</li>

                <p>If there is a lack of involvement of people with disabilities in the creation process...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are at the initial stages of the creation process, plan out in what ways you can involve the intended users into different stages of the creation process. 
                        Start by looking into the concepts of co-design and participatory design.</li>
                    <li>If you are in the later stages of the creation process, look into how you can involve the intended users as participants to evaluation studies, preferably during 
                        the prototyping stage rather than only at the end. Another helpful resource is to use an accessibility consultant to assess the technology.</li>

                    Think about what your goal for this assistive technology is and whether 
                    impact is a part of that goal. Do you truly want this technology to be a part of 
                    people’s lives after its inception? If so, consider setting up a detailed plan on how 
                    you can continue to develop this technology, finance it and bring it about to the world for people to use.
                    If not, why create it?

        <div id="introduction"> 
            <p>Some technologies that are created with "good" intentions can end up 
                effectively useless, sometimes even harmful. This can especially be 
                true when technology is made for people with disabilities. So how do 
                you avoid making bad assistive technologies? We created this guide and 
                framework to help you ask questions about your own work and suggest
                directions for how you can rethink, reframe, and adjust your approach.</p>

            <h2>Motivation: Avoiding Disability Dongles</h2>

            <p>Consider the following examples of bad assistive technology:</p>
            
            <b id="examples">Sign-Language Glove</b>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <a href="https://theindexproject.org/award/nominees/2051" target="_blank">
                    <img id="sign_lang_glove" src="imgs/sign_language_gloves.jpg" alt="two hands wearing sign language gloves">
                </a>
                <br>
                <cite id="citation">SignAloud - The Index Project</cite>
            </div>
            <p><b>Why is it <i>bad</i>?</b> The people who make these projects rarely
            consult with deaf people when they create it, which results in gloves that 
            make an assumption that sign language only occurs in the movement of 
            the hands, rather than with facial expressions and body language as well.</p>

            <b id="examples">Stair-Climbing Wheelchair</b>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <a href="https://www.scewo.com/en/" target="_blank">
                    <img id="stair_climbing" src="imgs/stair_climbing_wheelchair.jpg" alt="a person using a stair-climbing wheelchair on stairs">
                </a>
                <br>
                <cite id="citation">Scewo BRO - Scewo</cite>
            </div>
            <p><b>Why is it <i>bad</i>?</b> These wheelchairs are often very 
                expensive. For example, the Scewo BRO has an average selling price 
                of €45,000 (or over $50,800 USD). Furthermore, if the goal is to 
                create more accessible pathways, there is a cheaper and more effective 
                low-tech alternative that can serve a larger group of people: building
                    more ramps.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Liz Jackson, an advocate for disability-led design practice defined this type 
            of technology as the <b>disability dongle</b>. Disability dongles are assistive 
            technologies created to solve "a real or perceived problem experienced by 
            disabled people, but which was built without including disabled people in the design process."</p>

            <blockquote>
                   Disability Dongle rhetoric instills in students the value of a quick fix over 
                   <b>structural change</b>, thus preventing them from seeking out, participating in, and contributing 
                   to existing inquiry."

                <details>
                    <summary><b>What is "structural change"?</b></summary>
                    <ul><p> Ableism is the “the discrimination of and social prejudice against 
                        people with disabilities based on the belief that typical abilities 
                        are superior” and often relies on the idea that people with disabilities 
                        need 'fixing' (<a href="https://www.accessliving.org/newsroom/blog/ableism-101/">Ableism 101</a>). </p>
                    <p> Ableism, like many other forms of oppression, is often embedded 
                        in the various systems and institutions that make up a society 
                        such as within the government, healthcare or education. It exists 
                        in the form of “rules, policies, and procedures” that “stigmatize, 
                        exclude, or harm people with disabilities” (<a href="https://theabilitytoolbox.com/systemic-ableism/">Systemic Ableism</a>).</p>
                    <p> In this context, Liz Jackson distinguishes between quick fixes and structural 
                        change, because quick fixes are often bandage solutions to these issues that 
                        can only be fixed with structural change. Structural change is when you identify 
                        the root of the problem within a system or institution and address it from there.</p>
                    <p> For example, the stair-climbing wheelchair acts as a quick fix for the issue of 
                        inaccessible pathways, whereas the structural change would be advocating for 
                        more ramps and policy that would ensure more ramps across various areas. </p></ul>
                </details>
            </blockquote>
            

            <p>In that vein, we seek to provide a framework that leads designers to ask constructive questions 
            about their work and seek solutions with real impact for people with disabilities.</p> 
            
            <h2> Who are you? </h2>
            <p>You are a designer, researcher, engineer or student planning 
            to build or building an assistive technology targeted towards people with disabilities. 
            You want to create the best possible outcome for your technology such that it poses the least amount of harm to 
            the intended users of your product. You will use this tool to 
            identify any potential harm that your product might pose.</p>

            
            <h2>How to use?</h2> 
            <p>There are seven considerations that you need to consider when you are building 
            the assistive technology: 
            <ol>
                <li><a href="#rhetoric_of_tech">Rhetoric</a></li>
                <li><a href="#creation_process">Creation process</a></li>
                <li><a href="#problem_definition">Problem definition</a></li>
                <li><a href="#solution_def">Solution definition</a></li>
                <li><a href="#cost_of_tech">Cost</a></li>
                <li><a href="#use_of_tech">Usage</a></li>
                <li><a href="#impact_of_tech">Impact of technology</a></li>
            </ol>
            Under each of these considerations, there is a 
            series of questions that you answer to the best of your ability to help you interrogate 
            these considerations. You can answer these questions based on what you have already completed 
            in your design process or what you plan to do. It is better to answer these questions as early 
            as possible in the creation process to make it easier to reframe your work, if needed.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>Based on your answers to the <b>questions</b>, consider the <b>suggestions</b>.</p>
    
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="sec_title">Considerations</h2>
        
        <p id="considerations"> Note the <b>intended users</b> are the people who this assistive technology is meant to or 
            can serve. We don’t use the general term person with disability to describe the user - even 
            though it adds a more 'human' element to describe the audience - to the type of people who assistive 
            technology is made for, because it is too general. For example, there needs to be a distinction 
            between a ‘person with a disability’ being involved in the design process of the technology vs a 
            person with the specific disability that the technology is meant to target.
        </p>

        <h3 id="rhetoric_of_tech"> Rhetoric of Technology</h3>
        <div> 
            <p>This consideration deals with the way the language is used to describe the technology and 
            the intended users, and whether the language aligns with what is preferred by the intended users.</p>
            
            <p>For rhetoric, the texts that should be analyzed are as follows: For <b>research papers</b> look at the wording in the 
            paper and other supporting material published by the creators. For <b>products</b>, look at the promotional material and other 
            materials published by the creators. Finally, for both projects also look at the informal messaging you use during the creation
            process (e.g. emails, meetings, etc.)</p>

                <h4>Questions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Does the messaging around the technology involve harmful terminology? (Answer with reference to <a href="https://www.ungeneva.org/sites/default/files/2021-01/Disability-Inclusive-Language-Guidelines.pdf#page=5.11">
                        UN list of terminology to avoid</a>)</li>
                    <details>
                        <summary><b>Why?</b></summary>
                        <ul>
                            <p>The language we use to describe people with disabilities is important because it can reinforce harmful stereotypes or 
                                stigmatize individuals. This language is often patronizing in which people with disabilities are looked down upon 
                                as different or worthy of less. </p>
                            <p>For example the use of the term “wheelchair bound” is commonly 
                                rejected because it reinforces the idea that people who use wheelchairs 
                                are victims that are confined or restricted to their wheelchair. </p>
                        </ul>
                    </details>
                    <hr>
                    <li>Does the messaging around the technology focus more on the innovation than the assistance it provides to the user?</li>
                    <details>
                        <summary><b>Why?</b></summary>
                        <ul>
                            <p>Many people who create dongles build an innovative technology and then to ‘give it purpose’ 
                                they tack on accessibility towards the end. This is often evident in the language they 
                                use to describe the technology, in which innovation comes first and accessibility comes second.</p>
                            <p>When it comes to building assistive technology, accessibility must be the primary purpose of 
                                the technology since its inception, so the researchers and designers can take the necessary 
                                steps to involve people with disabilities in their creation process and create a technology 
                                that solves a real problem people with disabilities have. </p>
                        </ul>
                    </details>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Suggestions</h4> 
                <p>If the messaging uses harmful terminology...</p>
                Reframing the messaging you use, based on the provided resource.
                <hr>
                <p>If there is more focus on the innovation of the technology...</p>
                Think about what the purpose of creating this technology has been for you. Is it to create something innovative or is it to help people? 
                If innovation takes a higher importance, consider broadening the scope of the technology beyond assistive technology. If helping people is 
                more important, consider focusing more on the benefits and impact the technology has on the intended audience in its messaging.

        <div>
            <p> This consideration is the one of the most important characteristics that 
                can make or break an assistive technology. It deals with whether, when, 
                and how the intended audience is involved in the creation process of the 
                technology.</p> 
            <p> A lack of involvement from the intended audience will lead to a 
                project that isn’t based on evidence that it is in fact solving a real problem 
                that the intended audience has in a manner that will and can be used by the intended 
                audience.</p>

                    <li>If you are in the later stages of the creation process, look into how you can involve the intended users as participants to evaluation studies, preferably during

                    <li>How does the technology solve the ‘problem’?</li>
                    <li>Based on the solution defined, does the solution expect the 
                        intended user to change something about themselves to fit into

                                <p>As explained above, ableism is often rooted in the idea that disabilities need ‘fixing’. 
                                    This is often presented in dongles that expect users to conform to societal norms.</p>
                                <p> For example, autistic people are often the target of these technologies, where they are expected 
                                    to speak or act differently, because the way they speak or act may be different to what society 
                                    expects of them.</p> 
                                <p> Technologies that are then designed for autistic people “correct” their speaking, 
                                    mannerisms, or other behaviors, in order to conform to a normative set of expectations</p>

                        </details>

            <div>

                <p>If the solution expects the intended user to conform to normative standards...</p>
                
                Think about why a framing such as this is problematic and can enact harm on the intended users. 
                Then, reframe your solution such that it doesn’t have these expectations on its users or consider 
                broadening the scope of the technology beyond assistive technology.

                Also, reflect on how these costs will translate into people’s lives. Then, based on these reflections, problem solve where to reduce 
                costs to make it more affordable or how the intended users can use external help such as government/non-government programs that can 
                help people afford it.

                <ul>
                    <li>If you are in an earlier stage of the creation phase (e.g. prototyping phase), consider conducting a series of evaluations with the intended audience or redesigning some of the affordances.</li>
                    <li>If you are in a later stage of the creation phase, consider creating informational material alongside the technology and conducting an evaluation of how well these materials work.</li>

                            An information material that is a printed paper won't be helpful for someone who is blind. 
                            Instead, a better option is material that is offered as an online HTML file or alongside a braille 
                            hand guide.

                <p>If there is a lack of a plan for how this assistive technology 
                    will be sustained in the future...</p>

                    Think about what your goal for this assistive technology is and whether 
                    impact is a part of that goal. Do you truly want this technology to be a part of 
                    people’s lives after its inception? If so, consider setting up a detailed plan on how 
                    you can continue to develop this technology, finance it and bring it about to the world for people to use.
                    If not, why create it?
